Horme Hardware is keen to start with a proof-of-value (POV) focused on sales assistance, covering both:
•	Direct sales support – including generating quotations from customer BOMs, SKU lookup, and related functions.
•	Over-the-counter sales – assisting walk-in customers with enquiries and real-time support.

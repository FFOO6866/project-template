# FE-004-Basic-Error-Handling

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** nexus-specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours  
**Phase:** 1 - Integration Bridge (Days 1-3)

## Description

Implement comprehensive error handling and loading states throughout the Next.js frontend to provide users with clear feedback during API interactions. This includes network errors, validation errors, loading indicators, and user-friendly error messages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Global error boundary implemented for React error catching
- [ ] Loading states implemented for all async operations
- [ ] Network error handling with retry mechanisms
- [ ] User-friendly error messages for different error types
- [ ] Toast notifications for success/error states
- [ ] Form validation error display
- [ ] API error response handling and mapping
- [ ] Offline state detection and user notification
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-001: Next.js API Client Setup (for API error handling)
- FE-002: JWT Authentication Flow (for auth-related errors)
- FE-003: File Upload Pipeline (for upload error handling)

## Risk Assessment

- **MEDIUM**: Error message information disclosure (security)
- **MEDIUM**: Poor user experience during error states
- **LOW**: Loading state performance impact
- **LOW**: Toast notification accessibility issues

## Subtasks

- [ ] Global error handling setup (Est: 1h)
  - Create React Error Boundary component
  - Implement global error context
  - Set up error logging and reporting
- [ ] Loading states implementation (Est: 1h)
  - Create reusable loading components
  - Implement loading states in API hooks
  - Add skeleton loading for better UX
- [ ] Error message system (Est: 1h)
  - Create error message mapping system
  - Implement user-friendly error translations
  - Add contextual error displays
- [ ] Toast notifications (Est: 1h)
  - Set up toast notification system (already has sonner)
  - Implement success/error toast triggers
  - Configure toast positioning and styling

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Error boundary behavior, loading states, error message formatting
- [ ] Integration tests: API error scenarios, network failure handling
- [ ] E2E tests: User error journey scenarios, form validation errors

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Users receive clear feedback for all error states
- [ ] Loading indicators show during async operations
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Toast notifications work correctly
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No sensitive information leaked in error messages
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Error handling patterns documented

## Notes

- Frontend already includes sonner for toast notifications
- Use existing UI components from components/ui/ for consistent styling
- Implement proper error logging for debugging purposes
- Consider implementing retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Ensure accessibility compliance for error states and loading indicators

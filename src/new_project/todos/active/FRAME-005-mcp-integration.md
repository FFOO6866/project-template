# FRAME-005-MCP-Integration

## Description
Deploy the mcp-specialist to complete the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, enabling AI agents to execute workflows through the MCP server interface. This completes the full framework integration sequence: DataFlow → Nexus → MCP.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MCP server operational with workflow deployment capabilities
- [ ] AI agents can execute workflows through MCP interface
- [ ] MCP protocol properly integrated with Nexus platform
- [ ] Workflow execution accessible to AI agent systems
- [ ] MCP server health monitoring and logging operational
- [ ] Complete framework integration validated (DataFlow + Nexus + MCP)

## Dependencies
- FRAME-003: Nexus platform operational with MCP channel ready
- mcp-specialist: Available for deployment
- AI agent testing capability for validation

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW**: MCP built on established Core SDK patterns
- **MEDIUM**: AI agent workflow execution requires careful protocol handling
- **MEDIUM**: Integration with external AI systems may need protocol refinement
- **LOW**: MCP server provides standardized interface for AI agents

## Subtasks
- [ ] Deploy mcp-specialist automation (Est: 1.5 days) - Execute MCP server deployment
- [ ] Configure MCP protocol handlers (Est: 4 hours) - Workflow execution endpoints
- [ ] Integrate with Nexus MCP channel (Est: 4 hours) - Platform integration
- [ ] Implement AI agent workflow execution (Est: 8 hours) - Core MCP functionality
- [ ] Validate AI agent integration (Est: 4 hours) - Test workflow execution
- [ ] Setup monitoring and logging (Est: 4 hours) - MCP server observability

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests: MCP protocol handler functionality
- [ ] Integration tests: Nexus platform MCP channel integration
- [ ] E2E tests: AI agent workflow execution end-to-end

## MCP Features to Implement
- **Workflow Deployment**: AI agents can deploy and execute workflows
- **Protocol Handlers**: Standard MCP protocol for AI agent communication
- **Session Management**: AI agent sessions integrated with Nexus unified sessions
- **Health Monitoring**: MCP server status and performance tracking

## Commands to Execute
```bash
# Deploy mcp-specialist (automated)
# Specialist will handle implementation details

# Validation commands (after deployment)
mcp-server --status                    # MCP server operational
mcp-client --test-workflow             # AI agent workflow test
curl http://localhost:8001/mcp/health  # MCP health endpoint
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] MCP server operational with workflow deployment
- [ ] AI agents can execute workflows through MCP interface
- [ ] MCP protocol integrated with Nexus platform
- [ ] All MCP integration tests passing
- [ ] AI agent workflow execution documented and validated
- [ ] Complete framework integration achieved (DataFlow + Nexus + MCP)

## Success Metrics
- **Target**: AI agents can execute workflows through MCP interface
- **Time**: 3 days focused implementation
- **Validation**: Complete end-to-end AI agent workflow execution
- **Final Goal**: 100% framework integration with working examples

## Complete Integration Architecture
- **DataFlow**: Zero-config database operations with auto-generated nodes
- **Nexus**: Multi-channel platform (API + CLI + MCP) with unified sessions
- **MCP**: AI agent workflow execution through standardized protocol
- **Full Stack**: Complete AI-powered workflow automation platform operational

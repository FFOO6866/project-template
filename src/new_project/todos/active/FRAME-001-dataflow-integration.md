# FRAME-001-DataFlow-Integration

## Description
Deploy the dataflow-specialist to implement the DataFlow framework using the existing PostgreSQL service. DataFlow provides zero-config database operations with automatic model-to-node generation (@db.model decorator).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DataFlow framework integrated with PostgreSQL service
- [ ] @db.model decorator functional and generating 9 nodes per model
- [ ] Database models operational with auto-generated workflows
- [ ] Zero-config database operations working
- [ ] DataFlow examples working and validated
- [ ] Ready for Nexus platform integration

## Dependencies
- EXEC-004: PostgreSQL service running and healthy
- dataflow-specialist: Available for deployment

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW**: DataFlow built on Core SDK with validated patterns
- **MEDIUM**: PostgreSQL integration requires proper configuration
- **LOW**: @db.model decorator automates most complexity
- **MEDIUM**: Zero-config approach may need fine-tuning for production

## Subtasks
- [ ] Deploy dataflow-specialist automation (Est: 1 day) - Execute dataflow deployment
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL connection (Est: 4 hours) - Database integration setup
- [ ] Validate @db.model functionality (Est: 4 hours) - Test auto-node generation
- [ ] Create working examples (Est: 4 hours) - Demonstrate DataFlow capabilities
- [ ] Performance validation (Est: 4 hours) - Test database operations

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests: @db.model decorator functionality
- [ ] Integration tests: PostgreSQL connection and operations
- [ ] E2E tests: Complete DataFlow workflow execution

## Framework Features to Implement
- **@db.model decorator**: Automatic 9-node generation per model
- **Zero-config operations**: Database operations without manual configuration
- **Enterprise features**: Production-ready database patterns
- **Workflow integration**: Database operations as workflow nodes

## Commands to Execute
```bash
# Deploy dataflow-specialist (automated)
# Specialist will handle implementation details

# Validation commands (after deployment)
python -c "from kailash_dataflow import db; print('DataFlow imported successfully')"
pytest tests/integration/test_dataflow_*.py
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] DataFlow framework operational with PostgreSQL
- [ ] @db.model decorator generating 9 nodes per model automatically
- [ ] Zero-config database operations functional
- [ ] All DataFlow integration tests passing
- [ ] Working examples documented and validated
- [ ] Ready to proceed to FRAME-003 (Nexus platform)

## Success Metrics
- **Target**: DataFlow models operational with auto-generated nodes
- **Time**: 3 days focused implementation
- **Validation**: 9 nodes per model automatically generated and functional
- **Next Step**: FRAME-003 Nexus platform integration enabled

## Integration Architecture
- **Core SDK Foundation**: DataFlow built on WorkflowBuilder patterns
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Direct database connection using existing service
- **Auto-Node Generation**: @db.model creates CRUD + advanced operations
- **Zero-Config Approach**: Minimal configuration for maximum functionality

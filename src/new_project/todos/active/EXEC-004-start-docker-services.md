# EXEC-004-Start-Docker-Services

## Description
Deploy all production Docker services (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, ChromaDB, Redis, WireMock) using the production Docker Compose configuration. This establishes the complete service infrastructure needed for framework integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Execute docker-compose production configuration successfully
- [ ] All 5 services running and healthy
- [ ] Service health checks passing
- [ ] Network connectivity between services established
- [ ] Services accessible from host system
- [ ] Ready for framework integration (DataFlow → Nexus → MCP)

## Dependencies
- EXEC-002: Docker infrastructure deployed and operational
- EXEC-003: Environment validation completed

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW**: Docker Compose configuration already validated
- **MEDIUM**: Service startup may require port configuration
- **MEDIUM**: Multiple services may have interdependencies
- **LOW**: Health checks provide automatic validation

## Subtasks
- [ ] Start Docker services (Est: 3min) - Run docker-compose up -d
- [ ] Verify service health (Est: 2min) - Check all containers running
- [ ] Test service connectivity (Est: 2min) - Validate network accessibility

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Service tests: All containers running and healthy
- [ ] Network tests: Inter-service communication
- [ ] Integration tests: Host-to-service connectivity

## Commands to Execute
```bash
# Primary execution command
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Validation commands
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs --tail=10

# Health check validation
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

## Services to Deploy
- **PostgreSQL**: Database service (port 5432)
- **Neo4j**: Graph database service (port 7474, 7687)
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database service (port 8000)
- **Redis**: Cache service (port 6379)
- **WireMock**: API mocking service (port 8080)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] docker-compose production services started successfully
- [ ] All 5 services showing healthy status
- [ ] Service health checks passing
- [ ] Network connectivity validated
- [ ] Services accessible from host applications
- [ ] Ready for FRAME-001 (DataFlow integration)

## Success Metrics
- **Target**: 5/5 services operational with health checks
- **Time**: 5 minutes maximum
- **Validation**: All services responsive to health checks
- **Next Step**: Framework integration sequence enabled (DataFlow → Nexus → MCP)

## Health Check Validation
- **PostgreSQL**: Connection test on port 5432
- **Neo4j**: Web interface accessible on port 7474
- **ChromaDB**: API responsive on port 8000
- **Redis**: PING command successful on port 6379
- **WireMock**: Admin interface accessible on port 8080

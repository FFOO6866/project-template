# DOCKER-002-Phase2-Containerization

## Description
Phase 2: Complete containerization of all services with optimized Dockerfiles, Docker Compose setup, and comprehensive health checking. This phase transforms the application into a fully containerized architecture with production-ready configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Production-optimized Dockerfiles for all services (API, MCP, Nexus, DataFlow, Database)
- [ ] Multi-stage Docker builds with minimal image sizes
- [ ] Docker Compose orchestration with proper networking and volumes
- [ ] Comprehensive health checks for all containerized services
- [ ] Container security scanning and hardening implemented
- [ ] Development and production container configurations
- [ ] Container registry integration for image management
- [ ] Container networking and service discovery configured

## Dependencies
- DOCKER-001: Windows cleanup completed (prerequisite)
- EXEC-002: Infrastructure deployment working
- EXEC-004: Docker services operational

## Risk Assessment
- **HIGH**: Container networking issues may break service communication
- **HIGH**: Database persistence and volume management critical for data integrity
- **MEDIUM**: Multi-stage builds complexity may impact build times
- **MEDIUM**: Health check configuration must be accurate to prevent false failures
- **LOW**: Container security scanning may reveal dependency vulnerabilities

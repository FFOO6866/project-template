# FOUND-002: Architecture Setup - Hybrid AI System

**Created:** 2025-08-01  
**Assigned:** Architecture Team  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 16 hours  
**Due Date:** 2025-08-05

## Description

Design and implement the hybrid knowledge graph + embeddings + LLM architecture for the Horme AI knowledge-based assistance system. This architecture will support DIY hardware recommendations with tool-to-task relationships, safety compliance, and intelligent project guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Neo4j knowledge graph schema designed for tool-to-task relationships
- [ ] ChromaDB/Qdrant vector database configured for product embeddings
- [ ] OpenAI GPT-4 integration established for intelligent analysis
- [ ] Hybrid recommendation pipeline architecture documented
- [ ] Connection pooling and caching strategy implemented
- [ ] Multi-modal content processing pipeline designed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks establish <2s response time capability
- [ ] Integration points with DataFlow and Nexus defined

## Subtasks

- [ ] Knowledge Graph Schema Design (Est: 4h)
  - Verification: Complete Neo4j schema with nodes, relationships, and constraints
  - Output: Tool, Task, Project, User, Safety nodes with relationships
- [ ] Vector Database Architecture (Est: 3h)
  - Verification: ChromaDB configured with product embedding collections
  - Output: Collections for products, manuals, safety guidelines, project patterns
- [ ] LLM Integration Framework (Est: 3h)
  - Verification: OpenAI integration with prompt templates and response parsing
  - Output: Structured prompts for recommendations, safety analysis, project planning
- [ ] Hybrid Recommendation Pipeline (Est: 4h)
  - Verification: End-to-end pipeline combining graph queries, vector search, and LLM analysis
  - Output: Unified recommendation engine with confidence scoring
- [ ] Performance Optimization Strategy (Est: 2h)
  - Verification: Caching layers, connection pooling, and query optimization documented
  - Output: Performance architecture meeting <2s response requirements

## Dependencies

- FOUND-001: SDK Compliance Foundation (must complete first)
- Requires access to Neo4j, ChromaDB, and OpenAI services
- Integration with existing DataFlow models from src/dataflow_models.py

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH**: Complex multi-database architecture may have integration challenges
- **HIGH**: Performance requirements (<2s) may require significant optimization
- **MEDIUM**: External service dependencies (OpenAI, Neo4j) introduce failure points
- **MEDIUM**: Vector embedding quality critical for recommendation accuracy
- **LOW**: Schema evolution may require migration strategies

## Architecture Components

### Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)
```cypher
// Core node types
(Tool {name, category, brand, specifications, safety_rating})
(Task {name, complexity, required_skills, estimated_time})
(Project {name, type, difficulty_level, estimated_duration})
(User {skill_level, experience, preferences, safety_certification})
(SafetyRule {osha_code, ansi_standard, description, severity})

// Key relationships
(Tool)-[:USED_FOR]->(Task)
(Tool)-[:COMPATIBLE_WITH]->(Tool)
(Tool)-[:REQUIRES_SAFETY]->(SafetyRule)
(Task)-[:PART_OF]->(Project)
(User)-[:CAN_PERFORM]->(Task)
```

### Vector Database (ChromaDB)
- Product embeddings collection (specifications, descriptions)
- Manual embeddings collection (instruction texts)
- Safety guideline embeddings collection
- Project pattern embeddings collection

### LLM Integration (OpenAI GPT-4)
- Intelligent requirement analysis
- Safety assessment and recommendations
- Project complexity evaluation
- Natural language query processing

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Each component (graph, vector, LLM) functions independently
- [ ] Integration tests: End-to-end recommendation pipeline
- [ ] Performance tests: Response time validation under load
- [ ] Safety tests: OSHA/ANSI compliance verification

## Integration Points

### DataFlow Integration
- Use @db.model decorators for structured data (products, users, orders)
- Auto-generated nodes for CRUD operations on product catalogs
- Connection to existing PostgreSQL schema

### Nexus Integration
- Multi-channel deployment (API, CLI, MCP)
- Session management across channels
- Real-time streaming capabilities

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Architecture documentation completed and reviewed
- [ ] Proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates <2s response time
- [ ] Integration tests pass with all three data sources
- [ ] Security review completed for external service integrations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and documented

## Notes

- Follow hybrid architecture patterns from DIY Hardware Recommendation research
- Implement knowledge graph patterns similar to Home Depot's multi-wise relationship analysis
- Use ETIM/UNSPSC classification standards for product categorization
- Ensure safety-first design with OSHA/ANSI compliance built-in

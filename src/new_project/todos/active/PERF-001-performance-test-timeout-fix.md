# PERF-001: Performance Test Timeout Fix

**Created:** 2025-08-04  
**Assigned:** sdk-navigator + testing-specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸš¨ P0 - IMMEDIATE  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Estimated Effort:** 15 minutes  
**Due Date:** 2025-08-04 (Immediate fix)

## Description

Fix performance test timeout configuration to resolve 1 failing performance test. sdk-navigator analysis identified that heavy performance tests require 300s timeout instead of the current default timeout configuration.

## Critical Issue Analysis

**Root Cause:** Performance benchmarks for large-scale operations (classification with 170k+ UNSPSC codes) require extended timeout
**Current Impact:** 1/1 performance test failing due to timeout
**Solution:** Configure pytest timeout to 300s for performance test suite

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Performance test timeout configured to 300 seconds
- [ ] Performance test suite runs without timeout failures
- [ ] Test infrastructure maintains appropriate timeouts for different test types
- [ ] No impact on other test suite execution times
- [ ] Performance benchmarks complete successfully within 300s limit

## Subtasks

- [ ] Update pytest.ini Performance Test Configuration (Est: 15min)
  - Verification: pytest.ini updated with performance-specific timeout
  - Output: Performance tests configured with 300s timeout
- [ ] Validate Performance Test Execution (Est: 30min)
  - Verification: Performance test completes without timeout error
  - Output: 1/1 performance test passing
- [ ] Confirm No Impact on Other Tests (Est: 15min)
  - Verification: Unit and integration tests maintain normal execution times
  - Output: All other test suites unaffected by performance timeout changes

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies (configuration-only change)
- Can execute immediately without blocking other work

## Risk Assessment

- **LOW**: Simple configuration change with minimal risk
- **LOW**: Performance test timeout extension may mask actual performance issues
- **NONE**: No impact on production code or other test execution

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1A: pytest Configuration Update (5 minutes)
```ini
# File: C:\Users\fujif\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\horme-pov\src\new_project\pytest.ini
[tool:pytest]
addopts = 
    -v
    --tb=short
    --timeout=120
    --timeout-method=thread

# Timeout overrides for specific test types
markers =
    performance: marks tests as performance benchmarks (timeout=300s)
    slow: marks tests as slow running (timeout=180s)
    unit: marks tests as unit tests (timeout=60s)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests (timeout=120s)
    e2e: marks tests as end-to-end tests (timeout=300s)

# Override timeout for performance tests specifically
timeout_performance = 300
```

### Phase 1B: Performance Test Validation (5 minutes)
```bash
# EXACT COMMANDS to execute:
cd C:\Users\fujif\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\horme-pov\src\new_project

# Test the performance timeout fix
python -m pytest tests/performance/ -v --timeout=300 -m performance

# If no performance-specific tests, test with any slow tests
python -m pytest -k "performance or slow" -v --timeout=300
```

### Phase 1C: Impact Validation (5 minutes)
```bash
# Validate other test suites maintain normal timeouts
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_foundation_working.py -v --timeout=60

# Quick validation of unit tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -x --timeout=120 --maxfail=3
```

## Testing Requirements

### Immediate Tests (Critical Priority)
- [ ] Performance test execution with 300s timeout
- [ ] Verification that performance benchmarks complete successfully
- [ ] Confirmation that other test suites maintain normal timeouts

### Validation Tests (After Fix)
- [ ] Complete performance test suite execution
- [ ] Cross-validation with unit and integration test execution times
- [ ] Performance benchmark results within acceptable ranges

## Definition of Done

- [ ] pytest.ini updated with performance test timeout configuration
- [ ] Performance test passes without timeout errors
- [ ] No regression in execution times for other test suites
- [ ] Performance benchmark completes within 300s limit
- [ ] Documentation updated with performance test timeout rationale

## Implementation Files

- `C:\Users\fujif\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\horme-pov\src\new_project\pytest.ini` (update existing)
- `C:\Users\fujif\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\horme-pov\src\new_project\tests\performance\test_performance_benchmarks.py` (validate)

## Success Metrics

- **Test Success Rate**: 1/1 performance test passing (100% improvement)
- **Execution Time**: Performance benchmarks complete within 300s
- **No Regression**: Other test suites maintain normal execution times
- **Configuration Impact**: Zero impact on production code performance

## Next Actions After Completion

1. **INFRA-005**: Docker infrastructure setup (parallel execution possible)
2. **TEST-007**: Compliance test fixes (depends on Docker services)
3. **VALID-001**: Production readiness validation (includes performance test success)

This task provides immediate resolution for the identified performance test timeout issue.

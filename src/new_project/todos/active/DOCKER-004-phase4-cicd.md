# DOCKER-004-Phase4-CICD

## Description
Phase 4: Complete CI/CD pipeline implementation with GitHub Actions, multi-cloud deployment automation, and comprehensive testing in containerized environments. This phase establishes automated delivery pipelines for consistent, reliable deployments across multiple cloud providers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, and deployment automation
- [ ] Multi-cloud deployment scripts (AWS, GCP, Azure) with infrastructure as code
- [ ] Automated testing pipelines running in containerized environments
- [ ] Security scanning and compliance validation in CI/CD
- [ ] Blue-green and canary deployment strategies implemented
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms and deployment validation gates
- [ ] Environment promotion workflows (dev → staging → prod)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting integration with deployment pipelines

## Dependencies
- DOCKER-003: Kubernetes orchestration operational (prerequisite)
- Helm charts validated across environments

## Risk Assessment
- **HIGH**: Multi-cloud deployment complexity may cause configuration drift
- **HIGH**: CI/CD pipeline failures may block all deployments
- **MEDIUM**: Security scanning integration may slow down build times
- **MEDIUM**: Blue-green deployment requires double resource allocation

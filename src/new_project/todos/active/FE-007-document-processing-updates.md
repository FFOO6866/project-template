# FE-007-Document-Processing-Updates

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** mcp-specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours  
**Phase:** 2 - Real-Time Features (Days 4-7)

## Description

Implement real-time progress updates for document processing through WebSocket communication, showing users the status of AI-powered document analysis, extraction, and processing. This integrates with the DocumentProcessingQueue model and MCP server processing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time document processing status updates through WebSocket
- [ ] Progress indicators for different processing stages
- [ ] Integration with DocumentProcessingQueue status tracking
- [ ] Visual progress bars and status messages
- [ ] Error state handling for processing failures
- [ ] Completion notifications with processed document access
- [ ] Processing time estimates and remaining time display
- [ ] Cancel processing functionality
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-005: WebSocket Client Integration (for real-time updates)
- FE-003: File Upload Pipeline (for document upload integration)
- DocumentProcessingQueue model and MCP server processing
- Document viewer components (document-viewer.tsx, document-panel.tsx)

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH**: Processing progress accuracy and synchronization
- **MEDIUM**: Long-running process user experience and timeout handling
- **MEDIUM**: Error state communication and recovery options
- **LOW**: Progress indicator performance impact

## Subtasks

- [ ] Processing status WebSocket integration (Est: 2h)
  - Connect to document processing status WebSocket messages
  - Implement status update handlers
  - Create processing queue status management
- [ ] Progress UI components (Est: 2h)
  - Enhance document-panel.tsx with progress indicators
  - Create processing status badges and progress bars
  - Implement stage-based progress visualization
- [ ] Processing lifecycle management (Est: 1h)
  - Implement processing start/cancel functionality
  - Handle processing completion and result display
  - Add error state handling and retry options
- [ ] Integration with document viewer (Est: 1h)
  - Update document-viewer.tsx with processing status
  - Show processed document results
  - Implement processed content navigation

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Progress component behavior, status update handling
- [ ] Integration tests: Real document processing with progress updates
- [ ] E2E tests: Complete document upload and processing user journey

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Users see real-time progress during document processing
- [ ] Processing stages clearly communicated to users
- [ ] Error states properly handled and communicated
- [ ] Processing can be cancelled when needed
- [ ] Completion notifications work correctly
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No performance issues with progress updates
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Document processing flow documented

## Notes

- DocumentProcessingQueue model tracks processing status and progress
- MCP server processes multiple document types: PDF, Excel, Word, images
- WebSocket handlers support DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_* message types
- Processing includes extraction, AI analysis, and content generation
- Consider implementing progress estimation based on document size and type
- Existing document components available for enhancement

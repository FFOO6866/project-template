# EXEC-003-Run-Validation

## Description
Execute the comprehensive environment validation script to establish an accurate baseline of production readiness and identify any remaining issues before service deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Execute validate_environment.py script successfully
- [ ] Generate validation_report.json with complete assessment
- [ ] Obtain accurate production readiness percentage
- [ ] Identify any remaining blockers or issues
- [ ] Confirm environment ready for Docker service deployment
- [ ] Document baseline metrics for progress tracking

## Dependencies
- EXEC-002: Infrastructure deployed (WSL2 + Docker operational)
- All imports resolved from EXEC-001

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW**: Validation script already tested and automated
- **LOW**: Read-only assessment with no system modifications
- **MEDIUM**: May reveal unexpected issues requiring immediate attention
- **LOW**: Comprehensive reporting enables informed decision-making

## Subtasks
- [ ] Execute validation script (Est: 10min) - Run validate_environment.py
- [ ] Review validation report (Est: 3min) - Analyze validation_report.json
- [ ] Document baseline metrics (Est: 2min) - Record current production readiness

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Environment tests: Complete system health validation
- [ ] Service tests: Pre-deployment readiness checks
- [ ] Infrastructure tests: WSL2 and Docker validation

## Commands to Execute
```bash
# Primary execution command
python src/new_project/validate_environment.py --output validation_report.json

# Review results
cat validation_report.json

# Quick status check
python src/new_project/validate_environment.py --summary
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] validate_environment.py executed without errors
- [ ] validation_report.json generated with complete assessment
- [ ] Production readiness percentage documented
- [ ] Any critical issues identified and noted
- [ ] Environment confirmed ready for service deployment
- [ ] Ready to proceed to EXEC-004 (Docker services deployment)

## Success Metrics
- **Target**: Accurate production readiness baseline established
- **Time**: 15 minutes maximum
- **Validation**: Complete assessment report generated
- **Next Step**: EXEC-004 Docker services deployment enabled

## Expected Results
- **Infrastructure**: WSL2 + Docker operational
- **Imports**: 0 violations after EXEC-001 fix
- **Services**: Ready for deployment
- **Readiness**: Baseline established for progress tracking

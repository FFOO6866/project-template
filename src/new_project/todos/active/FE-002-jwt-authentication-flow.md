# FE-002-JWT-Authentication-Flow

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** nexus-specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours  
**Phase:** 1 - Integration Bridge (Days 1-3)

## Description

Implement comprehensive JWT authentication flow connecting Next.js frontend to the existing Nexus authentication system. This includes login/logout functionality, token management, protected routes, and session persistence across browser refreshes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Login form component created with validation
- [ ] Authentication API endpoints integrated (login/logout/refresh)
- [ ] JWT token storage and management implemented
- [ ] Protected route middleware configured
- [ ] Automatic token refresh mechanism implemented
- [ ] User session state management configured
- [ ] Logout functionality with token cleanup
- [ ] Authentication state persistence across browser refreshes
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-001: Next.js API Client Setup (for API communication)
- Nexus JWT authentication system (src/nexus_app.py)
- User and UserSession DataFlow models

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH**: Token security vulnerabilities (XSS, storage issues)
- **HIGH**: Session timeout handling and user experience
- **MEDIUM**: Token refresh race conditions
- **MEDIUM**: Protected route configuration complexity
- **LOW**: Authentication state management bugs

## Subtasks

- [ ] Create authentication context and hooks (Est: 2h)
  - Create AuthContext with React Context API
  - Implement useAuth hook for component usage
  - Set up authentication state management
- [ ] Implement login/logout components (Est: 2h)
  - Create login form with validation (react-hook-form + zod)
  - Implement logout functionality
  - Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] JWT token management (Est: 2h)
  - Implement secure token storage (httpOnly cookies preferred)
  - Create token refresh mechanism
  - Handle token expiration gracefully
- [ ] Protected routes middleware (Est: 1h)
  - Create route protection wrapper component
  - Implement redirect logic for unauthenticated users
  - Handle authentication state checks
- [ ] Session persistence (Est: 1h)
  - Implement authentication state rehydration
  - Handle browser refresh scenarios
  - Maintain user session across page reloads

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Authentication context, hooks, token management functions
- [ ] Integration tests: Login/logout flow with real API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests: Complete authentication user journey, protected route access

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Users can successfully log in and log out
- [ ] JWT tokens properly managed and refreshed
- [ ] Protected routes only accessible to authenticated users
- [ ] Authentication state persists across browser refreshes
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities identified
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Authentication flow documented

## Notes

- Nexus platform already implements JWT authentication with HTTPBearer security
- DataFlow models include User and UserSession for authentication state
- Consider using httpOnly cookies for token storage to prevent XSS attacks
- Authentication context should be available throughout the application
- Implement proper error handling for network failures during authentication

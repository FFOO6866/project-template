# FE-008-AI-Response-Streaming

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** mcp-specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours  
**Phase:** 2 - Real-Time Features (Days 4-7)

## Description

Implement real-time AI response streaming from the MCP server through WebSocket connections, providing users with immediate feedback as AI responses are generated. This creates a natural conversational flow similar to ChatGPT's streaming responses.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI responses stream character-by-character or chunk-by-chunk
- [ ] Smooth typing animation for streaming responses
- [ ] Integration with MCP server AI tools and capabilities
- [ ] Support for different content types (text, code, images, documents)
- [ ] Streaming cancellation capability
- [ ] Error handling for interrupted streams
- [ ] Response completion detection
- [ ] Token counting and rate limiting awareness
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-005: WebSocket Client Integration (for streaming communication)
- FE-006: Real-Time Chat Interface (for response display)
- MCP server AI capabilities and streaming support
- OpenAI/LLM integration in MCP server

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH**: Streaming interruption and incomplete response handling
- **HIGH**: Performance impact of frequent DOM updates during streaming
- **MEDIUM**: Network instability affecting stream continuity
- **MEDIUM**: Token limits and rate limiting during streaming
- **LOW**: Animation performance on slower devices

## Subtasks

- [ ] Streaming WebSocket protocol (Est: 2h)
  - Implement streaming message protocol
  - Handle chunked response reception
  - Create stream state management
- [ ] Response rendering system (Est: 3h)
  - Implement smooth character-by-character rendering
  - Create typing animation effects
  - Handle different content types during streaming
- [ ] Stream control mechanisms (Est: 2h)
  - Implement stream cancellation
  - Handle stream interruption recovery
  - Add stream completion detection
- [ ] Performance optimization (Est: 1h)
  - Optimize DOM updates during streaming
  - Implement efficient text accumulation
  - Add debouncing for rapid updates

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Streaming logic, response rendering, stream control
- [ ] Integration tests: Real AI streaming with MCP server
- [ ] E2E tests: Complete streaming conversation scenarios, stream cancellation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] AI responses stream smoothly and naturally
- [ ] Users can cancel streaming responses
- [ ] Different content types stream correctly
- [ ] No performance issues during streaming
- [ ] Stream interruptions handled gracefully
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No memory leaks from streaming operations
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] AI streaming integration documented

## Notes

- MCP server provides comprehensive AI tools including OpenAI integration
- WebSocket handlers support real-time AI response streaming
- Consider implementing response caching for frequently asked questions
- Ensure streaming works with different AI model response speeds
- Implement proper cleanup for cancelled or interrupted streams
- Consider implementing response quality indicators during streaming

# FE-009-Production-Environment-Setup

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** nexus-specialist  
**Priority:** âš¡ Medium  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours  
**Phase:** 3 - Production Deployment (Days 8-10)

## Description

Set up production deployment infrastructure for the Next.js frontend with optimized build configuration, environment management, and deployment pipeline. This includes containerization, production API configurations, and deployment automation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Production build configuration optimized
- [ ] Docker containerization for frontend application
- [ ] Environment variable management for production
- [ ] Production API endpoint configuration
- [ ] Static asset optimization and CDN integration
- [ ] Security headers and HTTPS configuration
- [ ] Health check endpoints for production monitoring
- [ ] Deployment automation scripts or CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-001 through FE-008: All frontend integration features completed
- Production backend infrastructure (Nexus, MCP server)
- Production database and services availability

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH**: Production environment configuration errors
- **HIGH**: Security vulnerabilities in production deployment
- **MEDIUM**: Performance issues in production environment
- **MEDIUM**: SSL/TLS certificate configuration
- **LOW**: Static asset serving issues

## Subtasks

- [ ] Production build optimization (Est: 2h)
  - Configure Next.js production build settings
  - Optimize bundle size and performance
  - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Docker containerization (Est: 2h)
  - Create production Dockerfile
  - Configure multi-stage build process
  - Optimize container size and security
- [ ] Environment configuration (Est: 1h)
  - Set up production environment variables
  - Configure API endpoints for production
  - Implement environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Deployment automation (Est: 1h)
  - Create deployment scripts
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline configuration
  - Implement health checks and monitoring

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Production configuration, environment handling
- [ ] Integration tests: Production API connectivity, deployment process
- [ ] E2E tests: Full application functionality in production-like environment

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Frontend successfully deployed to production environment
- [ ] Production build optimized for performance
- [ ] Environment configurations secure and functional
- [ ] Deployment process automated and reliable
- [ ] All tests passing in production environment
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Production deployment documented

## Notes

- Use Next.js production best practices for build optimization
- Consider using Docker multi-stage builds for smaller production images
- Implement proper security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Set up monitoring and logging for production environment
- Ensure production API endpoints are properly configured
- Consider implementing blue-green deployment strategy

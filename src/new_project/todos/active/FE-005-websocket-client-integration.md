# FE-005-WebSocket-Client-Integration

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** mcp-specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours  
**Phase:** 2 - Real-Time Features (Days 4-7)

## Description

Integrate React frontend with the existing WebSocket handlers (707 lines) to enable real-time communication between the frontend and backend. This includes connection management, message handling, reconnection logic, and integration with the existing WebSocket infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WebSocket client library configured and connected
- [ ] Connection state management implemented (connected, disconnected, reconnecting)
- [ ] Message type handling for all WebSocket message types
- [ ] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- [ ] Authentication integration with WebSocket connections
- [ ] Real-time connection status indicators in UI
- [ ] Message queue for offline message handling
- [ ] Error handling for WebSocket failures
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-002: JWT Authentication Flow (for authenticated WebSocket connections)
- WebSocket handlers infrastructure (src/websocket_handlers.py)
- Nexus WebSocket support (src/nexus_app.py)

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH**: WebSocket connection instability and reconnection issues
- **HIGH**: Message ordering and delivery guarantees
- **MEDIUM**: Authentication integration with WebSocket connections
- **MEDIUM**: Memory leaks from unmanaged connections
- **LOW**: Browser WebSocket API compatibility

## Subtasks

- [ ] WebSocket client setup (Est: 2h)
  - Install WebSocket client library or use native WebSocket API
  - Create WebSocket context and provider
  - Implement connection management logic
- [ ] Message handling system (Est: 2h)
  - Implement message type routing based on MessageType enum
  - Create message handlers for each message type
  - Set up message serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Connection management (Est: 2h)
  - Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Create connection state management
  - Add heartbeat/ping-pong mechanism
- [ ] Authentication integration (Est: 1h)
  - Integrate JWT tokens with WebSocket authentication
  - Handle authentication failures and re-authentication
  - Implement secure WebSocket connection establishment
- [ ] UI integration (Est: 1h)
  - Create connection status indicators
  - Implement real-time status updates in components
  - Add offline/online state management

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: WebSocket client logic, message handling, connection management
- [ ] Integration tests: Real WebSocket connections with backend handlers
- [ ] E2E tests: Full real-time communication scenarios, connection recovery

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] WebSocket client successfully connects to backend
- [ ] All message types properly handled
- [ ] Automatic reconnection working reliably
- [ ] Authentication integrated with WebSocket connections
- [ ] Connection status visible to users
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No memory leaks or connection issues
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] WebSocket integration documented

## Notes

- Backend WebSocket handlers support MessageType enum with 15+ message types
- WebSocket handlers include: CONNECT, DISCONNECT, HEARTBEAT, CHAT_MESSAGE, etc.
- Backend implements comprehensive message routing and user presence tracking
- Consider implementing message acknowledgment system for critical messages
- WebSocket endpoint available through Nexus platform FastAPI integration

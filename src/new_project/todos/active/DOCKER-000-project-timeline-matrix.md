### Inter-Task Dependencies

#### Critical Path Analysis
1. **Windows Cleanup → Containerization**: Must remove Windows dependencies before Docker builds
2. **Containerization → Orchestration**: Requires stable containers with health checks
3. **Orchestration → CI/CD**: Needs validated Kubernetes deployments
4. **CI/CD → Production**: Requires automated deployment capabilities

#### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **Documentation** can be created in parallel with implementation tasks
- **Security scanning** can be configured while services are being containerized
- **Monitoring setup** can begin during Kubernetes deployment phase
- **Multi-cloud infrastructure** can be provisioned in parallel

## Resource Allocation and Team Structure

### Recommended Team Composition
- **1 DevOps Engineer** (Lead): Overall project coordination and infrastructure
- **2 Backend Developers**: Service containerization and application changes
- **1 Platform Engineer**: Kubernetes, Helm, and orchestration
- **1 SRE Engineer**: Monitoring, security, and operational procedures

### Time Allocation by Phase
```
Phase 1 (40h total):
├── DevOps Lead: 16h (Windows cleanup coordination)
├── Backend Dev 1: 12h (Code cleanup)
├── Backend Dev 2: 12h (Test cleanup)

Phase 2 (72h total):
├── DevOps Lead: 24h (Docker optimization)
├── Backend Dev 1: 24h (Service containerization)
├── Backend Dev 2: 24h (Docker Compose setup)

Phase 3 (56h total):
├── Platform Engineer: 32h (Kubernetes deployment)
├── DevOps Lead: 24h (Helm charts and service mesh)

Phase 4 (68h total):
├── DevOps Lead: 36h (CI/CD pipeline)
├── Platform Engineer: 32h (Multi-cloud infrastructure)

Phase 5 (76h total):
├── SRE Engineer: 40h (Monitoring and operational procedures)
├── DevOps Lead: 36h (Security and compliance)
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Multi-Cloud Complexity** (PHASE-4)
   - Risk: Configuration drift between cloud providers
   - Mitigation: Infrastructure as Code with automated validation
   - Contingency: Focus on single cloud provider initially

2. **Service Mesh Learning Curve** (PHASE-3)
   - Risk: Istio complexity may cause delays
   - Mitigation: Start with basic Kubernetes networking, add service mesh incrementally
   - Contingency: Use standard Kubernetes services without service mesh

3. **Database Migration** (PHASE-2)
   - Risk: Data loss or extended downtime during containerization
   - Mitigation: Implement blue-green database deployment with replication
   - Contingency: Keep existing database external to containers initially

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Performance Regression** (PHASE-2/3)
   - Risk: Container overhead impacts application performance
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive performance testing and optimization
   - Contingency: Resource allocation adjustment and container tuning

2. **Security Compliance** (PHASE-5)
   - Risk: Security requirements may require architecture changes
   - Mitigation: Security review at each phase
   - Contingency: Additional security hardening phase if needed

# FE-006-Real-Time-Chat-Interface

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** mcp-specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 10 hours  
**Phase:** 2 - Real-Time Features (Days 4-7)

## Description

Connect the existing React chat interface components to the MCP AI assistant through WebSocket communication, enabling real-time conversational AI interaction. This includes message rendering, typing indicators, AI response handling, and integration with the 2,147-line MCP server capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Chat interface connected to WebSocket for real-time messaging
- [ ] AI assistant integration through MCP server communication
- [ ] Message history persistence and display
- [ ] Typing indicators for both user and AI
- [ ] Rich message formatting (text, code, images, documents)
- [ ] Message status indicators (sending, sent, delivered, failed)
- [ ] AI context awareness with document and user data
- [ ] Real-time message streaming from AI responses
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-005: WebSocket Client Integration (for real-time communication)
- MCP server AI capabilities (src/sales_assistant_mcp_server.py)
- Chat interface components (chat-interface.tsx, floating-chat.tsx)

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH**: AI response latency and user experience expectations
- **HIGH**: Message ordering and synchronization issues
- **MEDIUM**: Rich content rendering security vulnerabilities
- **MEDIUM**: Chat history performance with large message volumes
- **LOW**: Typing indicator synchronization issues

  - Implement message status indicators
  - Add timestamp and sender information
- [ ] AI response handling (Est: 3h)
  - Integrate with MCP server AI assistant tools
  - Implement streaming response handling
  - Add AI context management (document awareness)
- [ ] Real-time features (Est: 1h)
  - Implement typing indicators
  - Add real-time message status updates
  - Create presence indicators
- [ ] Chat history management (Est: 1h)
  - Implement message persistence
  - Add chat history loading and pagination
  - Create message search functionality

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Chat component behavior, message formatting, AI integration
- [ ] Integration tests: Real-time messaging with MCP server, WebSocket communication
- [ ] E2E tests: Complete conversational AI user journey, document-aware responses

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Users can have real-time conversations with AI assistant
- [ ] AI responses stream naturally through WebSocket
- [ ] Message history persists and displays correctly
- [ ] Rich content renders safely and correctly
- [ ] Typing indicators work for both user and AI
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in message rendering
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Chat interface integration documented

## Notes

- Existing components: chat-interface.tsx, floating-chat.tsx available
- MCP server provides comprehensive AI capabilities with document processing
- WebSocket handlers support CHAT_MESSAGE, CHAT_RESPONSE, TYPING_* message types
- AI assistant has access to document context and user data through DataFlow models
- Consider implementing message encryption for sensitive conversations
- MCP server supports multi-modal content including images and documents

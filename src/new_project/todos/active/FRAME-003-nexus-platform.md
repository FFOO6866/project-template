# FRAME-003-Nexus-Platform

## Description
Deploy the nexus-specialist to implement the Nexus multi-channel platform. Nexus provides simultaneous API + CLI + MCP access to workflows with unified session management, built on the Core SDK foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Nexus platform deployed with multi-channel support
- [ ] API channel operational and accessible
- [ ] CLI channel functional with command interface
- [ ] MCP channel ready for AI agent integration
- [ ] Unified session management working across all channels
- [ ] Zero-config platform deployment operational
- [ ] Ready for MCP specialist integration

## Dependencies
- FRAME-001: DataFlow integration complete and operational
- nexus-specialist: Available for deployment
- All Docker services healthy (API, database, etc.)

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW**: Nexus built on Core SDK with validated architecture
- **MEDIUM**: Multi-channel coordination requires careful session management
- **MEDIUM**: API + CLI + MCP simultaneous operation complexity
- **LOW**: Zero-config approach reduces deployment complexity

## Subtasks
- [ ] Deploy nexus-specialist automation (Est: 1.5 days) - Execute Nexus deployment
- [ ] Configure API channel (Est: 4 hours) - REST API setup and validation
- [ ] Configure CLI channel (Est: 4 hours) - Command-line interface setup
- [ ] Configure MCP channel (Est: 4 hours) - MCP protocol implementation
- [ ] Implement unified sessions (Est: 8 hours) - Cross-channel session management
- [ ] Validate multi-channel operation (Est: 4 hours) - Test simultaneous access

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests: Individual channel functionality
- [ ] Integration tests: Cross-channel session management
- [ ] E2E tests: Multi-channel workflow execution

## Platform Channels to Deploy
- **API Channel**: REST API with workflow endpoints
- **CLI Channel**: Command-line interface for direct workflow execution
- **MCP Channel**: Model Context Protocol for AI agent integration
- **Session Management**: Unified sessions across all channels

## Commands to Execute
```bash
# Deploy nexus-specialist (automated)
# Specialist will handle implementation details

# Validation commands (after deployment)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health  # API channel
nexus-cli --version                    # CLI channel
nexus-mcp --status                     # MCP channel ready
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Nexus platform operational with all 3 channels
- [ ] API + CLI + MCP channels working simultaneously
- [ ] Unified session management functional
- [ ] All Nexus integration tests passing
- [ ] Multi-channel examples documented and validated
- [ ] Ready to proceed to FRAME-005 (MCP integration)

## Success Metrics
- **Target**: API + CLI + MCP channels operational simultaneously
- **Time**: 3 days focused implementation
- **Validation**: Seamless session management across all channels
- **Next Step**: FRAME-005 MCP integration for AI agent workflows

## Multi-Channel Architecture
- **API Channel**: RESTful endpoints for web applications
- **CLI Channel**: Command-line interface for system integration
- **MCP Channel**: AI agent communication protocol
- **Unified Sessions**: Single session ID works across all channels
- **Zero-Config Deploy**: Minimal setup for complete platform functionality

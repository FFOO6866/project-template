**Created:** 2025-08-01  
**Assigned:** Testing Specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours  
**Due Date:** 2025-08-03

## Description

Establish comprehensive 3-tier testing strategy with real infrastructure for the AI knowledge-based assistance system. This includes unit tests, integration tests with real databases, and end-to-end performance validation with realistic data volumes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tier 2 (Integration): Real PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and ChromaDB connections tested
- [ ] Tier 3 (E2E): Full system performance validated with realistic data loads
- [ ] Docker test environment configured for consistent testing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration prepared
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for <2s response requirement
- [ ] Test data generation utilities created
- [ ] Safety compliance testing framework established

## Subtasks

- [ ] Docker Test Environment Setup (Est: 2h)
  - Verification: PostgreSQL, Neo4j, ChromaDB containers with test data
  - Output: docker-compose.test.yml with all required services
- [ ] Unit Test Framework (Est: 2h)
  - Verification: Pytest configuration with coverage reporting
  - Output: Test structure for nodes, models, and algorithms
- [ ] Integration Test Infrastructure (Est: 2h)
  - Verification: Real database connections and data flow validation
  - Output: Integration tests for DataFlow, Neo4j, and vector operations
- [ ] Performance Test Framework (Est: 1.5h)
  - Verification: Load testing with realistic data volumes
  - Output: Performance benchmarks and monitoring tools
- [ ] Test Data Generation (Est: 0.5h)
  - Verification: Utilities to generate realistic product, user, and safety data
  - Output: Data factories and fixtures for all test tiers

## Dependencies

- Docker environment for containerized testing
- Access to test databases (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, ChromaDB)
- Integration with existing test structure in tests/ directory

## Risk Assessment

- **MEDIUM**: Real database testing may be slower than mocked tests
- **MEDIUM**: Performance testing requires significant test data generation
- **LOW**: Docker environment setup may have platform-specific issues
- **LOW**: CI/CD integration may require additional configuration

## Testing Architecture

### Tier 1: Unit Tests (Isolated)
```python
# Test individual components without external dependencies
tests/unit/
â”œâ”€â”€ test_recommendation_engine.py
â”œâ”€â”€ test_safety_compliance.py
â”œâ”€â”€ test_classification_system.py
â”œâ”€â”€ test_dataflow_models.py
â””â”€â”€ test_embedding_pipeline.py
```

### Tier 2: Integration Tests (Real Services)
```python
# Test with real database connections
tests/integration/
â”œâ”€â”€ test_postgresql_operations.py

    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: horme_test
      POSTGRES_USER: test_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test_pass
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./test-data/postgres:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d

      NEO4J_AUTH: neo4j/test_password
      NEO4J_PLUGINS: '["apoc"]'
    ports:
      - "7475:7474"
      - "7688:7687"
    volumes:

    image: chromadb/chroma:latest
    ports:
      - "8001:8000"
    volumes:

```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Requirements
- Product search: < 500ms
- Recommendation generation: < 2s
- Safety compliance check: < 1s
- Knowledge graph queries: < 800ms

### Product Data Factory
```python
class ProductDataFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_products(count: int) -> List[Product]:
        """Generate realistic product data with UNSPSC codes"""
        
    @staticmethod
    def create_safety_standards(count: int) -> List[SafetyStandard]:

## Implementation Files

- `C:\Users\fujif\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\horme-pov\tests\` (extend existing structure)
- `C:\Users\fujif\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\horme-pov\docker-compose.test.yml`
- `C:\Users\fujif\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\horme-pov\test-data\` (test data fixtures)
- `C:\Users\fujif\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\horme-pov\src\new_project\tests\` (project-specific tests)

## Notes

- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Use real infrastructure for Tier 2/3 tests (NO MOCKING for databases)
- Ensure test isolation and cleanup between test runs
- Performance tests should simulate realistic user behavior
- Safety compliance tests must validate legal accuracy

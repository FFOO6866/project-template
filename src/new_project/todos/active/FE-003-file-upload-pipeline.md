# FE-003-File-Upload-Pipeline

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** nexus-specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours  
**Phase:** 1 - Integration Bridge (Days 1-3)

## Description

Connect the existing Next.js document upload UI components to the Nexus file upload endpoints, enabling users to upload documents (PDF, Excel, Word) for AI processing. This includes progress tracking, file validation, and integration with the document processing queue.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File upload component integrated with Nexus endpoints
- [ ] File type validation implemented (PDF, Excel, Word, images)
- [ ] File size limits enforced and user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Upload progress indicators working
- [ ] Drag-and-drop functionality operational
- [ ] Multiple file upload support
- [ ] Integration with Document and DocumentProcessingQueue models
- [ ] Error handling for upload failures and network issues
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-001: Next.js API Client Setup (for API communication)
- FE-002: JWT Authentication Flow (for authenticated uploads)
- Nexus file upload endpoints (src/nexus_app.py)
- Document processing infrastructure (MCP server)

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH**: Large file upload failures and timeout issues
- **HIGH**: File validation bypasses and security vulnerabilities
- **MEDIUM**: Progress tracking accuracy and user experience
- **MEDIUM**: Multiple concurrent upload handling
- **LOW**: File type detection false positives

## Subtasks

- [ ] Enhance existing upload components (Est: 2h)
  - Update document-upload.tsx with Nexus API integration
  - Implement file validation logic
  - Add progress tracking capabilities
- [ ] File upload API integration (Est: 2h)
  - Connect to Nexus /upload endpoint
  - Implement multipart form data handling
  - Add authentication headers to upload requests
- [ ] Progress and status tracking (Est: 1h)
  - Implement upload progress indicators
  - Add upload status management (pending, uploading, completed, failed)
  - Create real-time progress updates
- [ ] Error handling and validation (Est: 1h)
  - Implement comprehensive file validation
  - Add user-friendly error messages
  - Handle network failures and retries

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: File validation, upload component behavior, progress tracking
- [ ] Integration tests: Actual file uploads to Nexus endpoints with various file types
- [ ] E2E tests: Complete file upload user journey from selection to processing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Users can successfully upload supported file types
- [ ] File validation prevents invalid uploads
- [ ] Upload progress accurately tracked and displayed
- [ ] Error states properly handled and communicated
- [ ] Multiple file uploads work correctly
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in file handling
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] File upload flow documented

## Notes

- Existing components: document-upload.tsx, document-panel.tsx available
- Nexus platform already has file upload endpoints configured
- MCP server processes documents: PDF, Excel, Word, images
- Document and DocumentProcessingQueue models track upload status
- Consider implementing chunked uploads for large files
- Ensure proper MIME type validation and file extension checking

# FE-012-Full-Error-Handling-and-Recovery

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** nexus-specialist  
**Priority:** âš¡ Medium  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours  
**Phase:** 3 - Production Deployment (Days 8-10)

## Description

Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms throughout the application, building on FE-004 Basic Error Handling with advanced recovery strategies, fallback UI components, and resilient user experience patterns for production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive error recovery strategies implemented
- [ ] Fallback UI components for failed states
- [ ] Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- [ ] Graceful degradation for service failures
- [ ] Offline mode detection and handling
- [ ] Data recovery and synchronization after errors
- [ ] User-friendly error reporting and feedback collection
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-004: Basic Error Handling (foundation)
- FE-005: WebSocket Client Integration (for connection error handling)
- FE-011: Monitoring and Logging (for error tracking)

## Risk Assessment

- **MEDIUM**: Complex error recovery logic introducing new bugs
- **MEDIUM**: User confusion during error recovery processes
- **LOW**: Performance impact of error handling overhead
- **LOW**: False positive error detections

## Subtasks

- [ ] Advanced error recovery (Est: 2h)
  - Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Create circuit breaker pattern for failing services
  - Add data recovery and synchronization logic
- [ ] Fallback UI system (Est: 2h)
  - Create fallback components for failed states
  - Implement graceful degradation patterns
  - Design offline mode UI and functionality
- [ ] User feedback and reporting (Est: 1h)
  - Add user error reporting functionality
  - Implement feedback collection for errors
  - Create error context collection for debugging
- [ ] Testing and validation (Est: 1h)
  - Test error scenarios and recovery paths
  - Validate fallback UI behavior
  - Verify error reporting accuracy

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Error recovery logic, fallback components, retry mechanisms
- [ ] Integration tests: End-to-end error scenarios, service failure recovery
- [ ] E2E tests: Complete error handling user journeys, offline scenarios

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Users experience graceful error recovery
- [ ] Fallback UI provides meaningful alternatives
- [ ] Automatic recovery works for transient failures
- [ ] Offline mode provides useful functionality
- [ ] Error reporting helps with debugging
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No error handling logic bugs
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Error handling patterns documented

## Notes

- Build upon the foundation established in FE-004 Basic Error Handling
- Focus on user experience during error states
- Implement progressive enhancement patterns
- Consider implementing service worker for offline functionality
- Ensure error recovery doesn't cause data loss or corruption
- Provide clear user guidance during error recovery processes

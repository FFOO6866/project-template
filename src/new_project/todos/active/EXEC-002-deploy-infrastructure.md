# EXEC-002-Deploy-Infrastructure

## Description
Execute the comprehensive WSL2 + Docker setup script to deploy the complete infrastructure needed for production readiness. This script automates the entire environment setup process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Execute setup_wsl2_environment.ps1 as Administrator successfully
- [ ] WSL2 environment operational and configured
- [ ] Docker Desktop installed and running
- [ ] All helper scripts created (wsl-dev.bat, docker-env.bat)
- [ ] Infrastructure ready for service deployment
- [ ] Environment validation script ready to run

## Dependencies
- EXEC-001: Import violations fixed (prevents script conflicts)
- Administrator privileges required for PowerShell execution

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW**: Script validated by sdk-navigator and ready for execution
- **MEDIUM**: Requires Administrator privileges (security consideration)
- **MEDIUM**: WSL2 installation may require system restart
- **LOW**: Complete automation reduces manual configuration errors

## Subtasks
- [ ] Verify Administrator privileges (Est: 2min) - Check PowerShell execution policy
- [ ] Execute WSL2 setup script (Est: 20min) - Run setup_wsl2_environment.ps1
- [ ] Verify WSL2 installation (Est: 3min) - Test wsl --list --verbose
- [ ] Confirm Docker operational (Est: 3min) - Test docker --version
- [ ] Validate helper scripts (Est: 2min) - Check wsl-dev.bat, docker-env.bat exist

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Infrastructure tests: WSL2 and Docker functionality
- [ ] Helper script tests: Batch file execution validation
- [ ] Environment tests: Path and variable configuration

## Commands to Execute
```powershell
# Primary execution command (Run as Administrator)
powershell src/new_project/setup_wsl2_environment.ps1

# Validation commands
wsl --list --verbose
docker --version
dir wsl-dev.bat
dir docker-env.bat
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] setup_wsl2_environment.ps1 executed successfully without errors
- [ ] WSL2 environment active and accessible
- [ ] Docker Desktop running with healthy status
- [ ] All helper scripts created and functional
- [ ] No system restart required (or restart completed)
- [ ] Ready to proceed to EXEC-003 (environment validation)

## Success Metrics
- **Target**: Complete WSL2 + Docker environment operational
- **Time**: 30 minutes maximum (including any required restart)
- **Validation**: All infrastructure components responsive
- **Next Step**: EXEC-003 environment validation enabled

## Fallback Plan
- **If WSL2 fails**: Use native Windows Docker Desktop only
- **If restart required**: Complete restart and continue with validation
- **If Docker issues**: Verify Windows version compatibility and retry

# DOCKER-003-Phase3-Orchestration

## Description
Phase 3: Complete Kubernetes orchestration with Helm charts, service mesh integration, and advanced deployment patterns. This phase transforms containerized services into a scalable, production-ready Kubernetes deployment with enterprise-grade orchestration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Production-ready Kubernetes manifests for all services
- [ ] Helm charts with configurable values for different environments
- [ ] Service mesh (Istio) implementation for traffic management and security
- [ ] Auto-scaling configurations (HPA and VPA) implemented
- [ ] Persistent volume management for stateful services
- [ ] Network policies and security contexts configured
- [ ] Ingress controllers and SSL/TLS termination setup
- [ ] Multi-environment deployment strategies (dev, staging, prod)

## Dependencies
- DOCKER-002: All services containerized with health checks (prerequisite)
- Kubernetes cluster access (development and production)
- Container registry with pushed images

## Risk Assessment
- **HIGH**: Kubernetes cluster configuration complexity may cause deployment failures
- **HIGH**: Service mesh integration may introduce network latency and complexity
- **MEDIUM**: Persistent volume configuration critical for database stateful services
- **MEDIUM**: Resource allocation and scaling policies must be correctly tuned
- **LOW**: Helm chart templating may require iterations for different environments

# FE-010-Performance-Optimization

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** nexus-specialist  
**Priority:** âš¡ Medium  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours  
**Phase:** 3 - Production Deployment (Days 8-10)

## Description

Implement comprehensive performance optimization for the Next.js frontend including caching strategies, lazy loading, bundle optimization, and runtime performance improvements to ensure fast loading times and smooth user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bundle size optimization with code splitting
- [ ] Image optimization and lazy loading implemented
- [ ] API response caching with proper cache invalidation
- [ ] Component lazy loading for large components
- [ ] Memory leak prevention and optimization
- [ ] Runtime performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] Loading time targets met (<3s initial load, <1s navigation)
- [ ] Core Web Vitals optimized (LCP, FID, CLS)
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-001 through FE-008: Core functionality completed
- FE-009: Production Environment Setup (for performance testing)

## Risk Assessment

- **MEDIUM**: Optimization breaking existing functionality
- **MEDIUM**: Caching strategy causing stale data issues
- **LOW**: Performance gains not meeting targets
- **LOW**: Lazy loading causing UI flickering

## Subtasks

- [ ] Bundle optimization (Est: 2h)
  - Implement code splitting for large components
  - Optimize third-party library imports
  - Remove unused dependencies and code
- [ ] Image and asset optimization (Est: 2h)
  - Implement Next.js Image component optimization
  - Add lazy loading for images and documents
  - Optimize static asset delivery
- [ ] Caching implementation (Est: 2h)
  - Implement API response caching with SWR or React Query
  - Add cache invalidation strategies
  - Configure browser caching headers
- [ ] Runtime optimization (Est: 1h)
  - Implement React.memo for expensive components
  - Optimize re-renders and state updates
  - Add performance monitoring and profiling
- [ ] Performance monitoring (Est: 1h)
  - Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
  - Add performance metrics collection
  - Set up performance alerts and monitoring

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Optimization logic, caching behavior, performance utilities
- [ ] Integration tests: Performance improvements, cache invalidation
- [ ] E2E tests: Loading time measurements, Core Web Vitals validation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Bundle size reduced by at least 30%
- [ ] Initial load time under 3 seconds
- [ ] Navigation time under 1 second
- [ ] Core Web Vitals scores in "Good" range
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] Performance regression tests implemented
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Performance optimization documented

## Notes

- Use Next.js built-in performance features (Image, Link, dynamic imports)
- Consider implementing service worker for advanced caching
- Monitor bundle analyzer reports to identify optimization opportunities
- Implement performance budgets to prevent regression
- Use React DevTools Profiler for runtime optimization
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large lists

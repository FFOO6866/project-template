# FE-001-Next.js-API-Client-Setup

**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** nexus-specialist  
**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours  
**Phase:** 1 - Integration Bridge (Days 1-3)

## Description

Configure Next.js frontend to communicate with the existing Nexus multi-channel platform through REST API endpoints. This involves setting up the API client infrastructure, environment configuration, and basic connectivity patterns to enable frontend-backend communication.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API client library installed and configured (axios/fetch wrapper)
- [ ] Environment variables configured for API endpoints
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for API request/response types
- [ ] API client instances created with proper base URL configuration
- [ ] Connection established and verified with Nexus REST endpoints
- [ ] Error handling implemented for network failures
- [ ] Request/response logging configured for development
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- Nexus platform running on backend (src/nexus_app.py)
- Next.js frontend structure (fe-reference/)
- Environment configuration for API URLs

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH**: Network connectivity issues between frontend and backend
- **HIGH**: CORS configuration problems preventing API calls
- **MEDIUM**: TypeScript type mismatches with API responses
- **MEDIUM**: Environment variable configuration errors
- **LOW**: API client library compatibility issues

## Subtasks

- [ ] Install API client dependencies (Est: 1h)
  - Install axios or create custom fetch wrapper
  - Install TypeScript types for HTTP client
  - Configure package.json dependencies
- [ ] Create API client infrastructure (Est: 2h)
  - Create src/lib/api-client.ts with base configuration
  - Set up request/response interceptors
  - Implement error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces (Est: 1h)
  - Create types for User, Document, Quote entities
  - Define API request/response interfaces
  - Set up shared type definitions
- [ ] Environment configuration (Est: 1h)
  - Configure .env.local for API endpoints
  - Set up environment-specific configurations
  - Document required environment variables
- [ ] Connection verification (Est: 1h)
  - Create health check endpoint call
  - Test API connectivity
  - Implement connection status indicator

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: API client configuration, error handling, request formatting
- [ ] Integration tests: Actual API calls to Nexus endpoints with mock data
- [ ] E2E tests: Full request/response cycle from UI components

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] API client successfully connects to Nexus platform
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined and working
- [ ] Environment configuration documented and working
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No CORS or network connectivity issues
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated for API client usage

## Notes

- Nexus platform already provides REST API endpoints in src/nexus_app.py
- Frontend uses Next.js 15.2.4 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- CORS middleware already configured in Nexus FastAPI application
- JWT authentication will be handled in FE-002

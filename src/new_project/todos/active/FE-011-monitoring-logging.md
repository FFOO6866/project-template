**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Assigned:** nexus-specialist  
**Priority:** âš¡ Medium  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours  
**Phase:** 3 - Production Deployment (Days 8-10)

## Description

Implement comprehensive frontend monitoring, logging, and analytics to track application performance, user behavior, errors, and system health in production. This includes error tracking, performance monitoring, and user analytics integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Error tracking and reporting system implemented
- [ ] Performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] User analytics and behavior tracking configured
- [ ] Real-time error alerts and notifications
- [ ] Application health monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Log aggregation and structured logging
- [ ] Privacy-compliant analytics implementation
- [ ] Custom event tracking for key user actions
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

- FE-009: Production Environment Setup (for production monitoring)
- FE-010: Performance Optimization (for performance metrics)

## Risk Assessment

- **MEDIUM**: Privacy compliance issues with user tracking
- **MEDIUM**: Performance impact of monitoring overhead
- **LOW**: False positive alerts and noise
- **LOW**: Data storage and retention costs

## Subtasks

- [ ] Error tracking setup (Est: 1h)
  - Integrate error tracking service (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
  - Configure error boundaries with reporting
  - Set up error alert notifications
- [ ] Performance monitoring (Est: 1h)
  - Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
  - Set up performance metrics collection
  - Configure performance alerts and thresholds
- [ ] User analytics (Est: 1h)
  - Integrate analytics service (privacy-compliant)
  - Track key user interactions and conversions
  - Implement custom event tracking
- [ ] Logging and health monitoring (Est: 1h)
  - Set up structured frontend logging
  - Implement application health checks
  - Create monitoring dashboard integration

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests: Monitoring utilities, event tracking, error handling
- [ ] Integration tests: Analytics integration, error reporting
- [ ] E2E tests: End-to-end monitoring validation, alert testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Error tracking captures and reports issues effectively
- [ ] Performance metrics collected and monitored
- [ ] User analytics provide actionable insights
- [ ] Alerts configured for critical issues
- [ ] Privacy compliance verified
- [ ] All tests passing (3-tier strategy)
- [ ] No significant performance impact from monitoring
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics documented

## Notes

- Consider using privacy-focused analytics solutions
- Implement proper data anonymization and user consent
- Set up meaningful alerts to avoid alert fatigue
- Use structured logging for better log analysis
- Consider implementing real user monitoring (RUM)
- Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for user data collection

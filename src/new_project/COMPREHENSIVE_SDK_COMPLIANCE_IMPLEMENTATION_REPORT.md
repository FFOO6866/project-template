## SDK Compliance Patterns

### Workflow Execution Pattern (Gold Standard)

```python
# ✅ CORRECT Pattern - Always used
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime

workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
workflow.add_node("UNSPSCClassificationNode", "classifier", {"product_data": data})
workflow.add_connection("data_source", "output", "classifier", "input")

runtime = LocalRuntime()
results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow.build())  # ALWAYS .build()
```

### Node Implementation Pattern

```python
@register_node()
class OptimizedClassificationNode(SecureGovernedNode):
    def run(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Performance optimization integration
        return optimize_node_execution(
            "NodeType", 
            inputs, 
            self._execute_core_logic
        )
    
    def get_parameters(self) -> Dict[str, NodeParameter]:
        # 3-method parameter support
        return {
            "param": NodeParameter(name="param", type=str, required=True)

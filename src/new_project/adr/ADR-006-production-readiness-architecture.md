# ADR-006: Production Readiness Architecture Strategy

## Status
**Accepted**  
**Date:** 2025-08-03  
**Authors:** Requirements Analysis Specialist  
**Reviewers:** Infrastructure Team, Performance Team, Security Team  

## Context

The Kailash SDK multi-framework implementation has achieved 75% production readiness with solid architectural foundations in place. The remaining 25% requires systematic infrastructure deployment, real service integration, and performance validation to meet enterprise SLA requirements.

### Current State Analysis
- **Completed (75%)**: Core SDK, DataFlow (13 models, 117 auto-generated nodes), Nexus platform, Windows compatibility, development environment, test framework
- **Remaining (25%)**: Docker infrastructure deployment, NO MOCKING policy compliance, multi-framework performance validation

### Business Requirements
- **Target**: 100% production readiness with enterprise SLA compliance
- **Timeline**: 14 days maximum to production deployment
- **Performance**: <500ms classification, <2s recommendations, 100+ concurrent users
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, <0.1% error rate, graceful degradation
- **Scalability**: Linear horizontal scaling, auto-scaling capabilities

### Technical Constraints
- Windows development environment must be maintained
- NO MOCKING policy must be enforced across all test tiers
- All 117 DataFlow auto-generated nodes must work with real services
- Multi-framework coordination (Core SDK + DataFlow + Nexus) required
- Resource efficiency: <70% CPU, <80% memory under normal load

## Decision

We adopt a **Hybrid WSL2 + Docker Infrastructure Architecture** with **Real Service Integration** and **Comprehensive Performance Validation** to achieve 100% production readiness.

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Infrastructure Architecture: WSL2 + Docker Hybrid
```yaml
infrastructure_decision:
  primary_platform: WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  containerization: Docker Compose for service orchestration
  networking: Bridge networks with Windows port forwarding
  data_persistence: Named volumes with backup strategies
  service_stack:
    - PostgreSQL 15 (primary database)
    - Neo4j 5.13 (knowledge graph with APOC/GDS)
    - ChromaDB 0.4.15 (vector database)
    - Redis 7 (caching and sessions)
    - OpenAI API (AI services)
    - Elasticsearch 8.10 (optional: advanced search)
    - MinIO (optional: object storage)
```

**Rationale**: WSL2 provides Unix-compatible environment for Linux-based services while maintaining Windows development workflow. Docker Compose offers production-like service orchestration with minimal complexity.

#### 2. Service Integration Architecture: NO MOCKING Policy
```yaml
service_integration_decision:
  policy: NO MOCKING in Tiers 2-3 testing
  connection_strategy: Real service connections with health checks
  fallback_mechanism: Circuit breakers and graceful degradation
  configuration_management: Environment-specific service configs
  error_handling: Comprehensive retry and recovery mechanisms
  
dataflow_integration:
  model_count: 13 business domain models
  auto_generated_nodes: 117 nodes requiring real service validation
  operations_per_model: 9 (CRUD, Search, Analytics, Export, Import, Validate, Transform, Aggregate, Cache)
  service_dependencies:
    - PostgreSQL: Primary data storage and complex queries
    - Neo4j: Relationship mapping and graph traversals
    - ChromaDB: Vector embeddings and similarity search
    - Redis: Caching and session management
    - OpenAI: AI classification and recommendation pipelines
```

**Rationale**: Real service integration ensures production parity and validates actual performance characteristics. Auto-generated nodes from DataFlow models must be tested against real infrastructure to ensure reliability.

#### 3. Performance Architecture: Multi-Framework Validation
```yaml
performance_architecture:
  monitoring_stack:
    - Prometheus: Metrics collection
    - Grafana: Visualization and dashboarding
    - Jaeger: Distributed tracing
    - Custom: Business logic performance tracking
    
  testing_framework:
    - Load testing: Realistic user scenarios with gradual ramp-up
    - Stress testing: Breaking point analysis and recovery validation
    - Endurance testing: Long-term stability and memory leak detection
    - Chaos testing: Service failure and network partition simulation
    
  performance_targets:
    response_times:
      classification: <500ms (95th percentile)
      recommendation: <2s (95th percentile)
      health_check: <100ms (99th percentile)
    throughput:
      api_requests: >1000 requests/second
      classifications: >500 classifications/second
      bulk_processing: >10k products/hour
    scalability:
      concurrent_users: 100+ simultaneous
      horizontal_scaling: 90% linear efficiency
      resource_utilization: <70% CPU, <80% memory
```

**Rationale**: Comprehensive performance validation ensures SLA compliance and identifies bottlenecks before production deployment. Multi-framework testing validates Core SDK, DataFlow, and Nexus performance under realistic conditions.

#### 4. Security Architecture: Defense in Depth
```yaml
security_architecture:
  network_security:
    - Service isolation in separate Docker networks
    - Minimal port exposure to Windows host
    - TLS encryption for all external connections
    - Firewall rules for service access control
    
  authentication_security:
    - Individual service authentication (no shared secrets)
    - Encrypted password storage and rotation
    - API key management for external services
    - Session security with Redis-based storage
    
  data_security:
    - Encrypted volumes for sensitive data
    - Encrypted backups with retention policies
    - Audit logging for all administrative actions
    - Role-based access control (RBAC)
```

**Rationale**: Multi-layered security ensures protection at network, service, and data levels while maintaining operational efficiency.

- Native Windows performance
- Simpler networking
**Cons**:
- Limited service availability (Neo4j, ChromaDB challenges)
- Different behavior from production Linux environment
- Path and filesystem compatibility issues
- Missing Unix-specific features
**Why Rejected**: Service availability and production parity concerns

### Option 3: Full Linux VM

**Pros**:
- Production-like orchestration
- Advanced scaling and management
- Industry standard approach
**Cons**:
- Significant complexity overhead
- Higher resource requirements
- Steep learning curve
- Overkill for single-developer environment
**Why Rejected**: Complexity exceeds benefits for current scale

### Option 5: Selective Mocking Approach
**Description**: Mock some services while using real services for others
**Pros**:
- Reduced resource requirements
- Faster test execution
- Lower setup complexity
**Cons**:
- Violates NO MOCKING policy
- Production parity compromised
- Hidden integration issues
- Reduced confidence in deployment readiness
**Why Rejected**: Conflicts with explicit NO MOCKING policy requirement

# ADR-010: Windows SDK to Cloud-Agnostic Docker Migration Architecture

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Deciders:** Platform Engineering Team, DevOps Team  
**Consulted:** Security Team, Infrastructure Team, Product Team  
**Informed:** Development Teams, Operations, Stakeholders

## Context

The current Horme platform runs on Windows-based SDK environments with:
- Kailash Core SDK with WorkflowBuilder and LocalRuntime
- DataFlow models with PostgreSQL backend (@db.model decorators generating 9 nodes per model)
- Nexus multi-channel platform (API/CLI/MCP)
- Windows-specific path handling and resource management
- Mixed deployment strategies causing operational complexity

Critical issues with current Windows deployment:
- Platform lock-in limiting cloud provider flexibility
- Inconsistent development/production environments
- Manual scaling and resource management
- Security patching complexity
- High operational overhead
- Limited CI/CD automation capabilities

## Decision Drivers

### Business Requirements
- **Multi-cloud flexibility**: Deploy across AWS, Azure, GCP without platform lock-in
- **Cost optimization**: Reduce infrastructure costs by 40-60%
- **Developer productivity**: Consistent dev/staging/prod environments
- **Operational efficiency**: Automated scaling, monitoring, and deployment
- **Security compliance**: Container-based security model with immutable infrastructure

### Technical Requirements
- **Zero-downtime migration**: No service interruption during transition
- **Performance parity**: Maintain current <100ms API response times
- **Data integrity**: PostgreSQL with vector extensions for classification models
- **Scalability**: Handle 10x traffic growth (1000+ concurrent users)
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics, logging, and tracing

### Operational Requirements
- **Automated deployment**: Full CI/CD pipeline with rollback capabilities
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Reproducible environments across all stages
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and alerting
- **Backup/Recovery**: Automated database backups with point-in-time recovery

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Lift-and-Shift Windows Containers
- Windows Server Core containers with existing SDK
- Minimal code changes required
- Direct port of current architecture

### Option 2: Hybrid Migration (Recommended)
- Linux-based containers with cloud-agnostic design
- Preserve Kailash SDK patterns and DataFlow models
- Containerize services with Docker Compose orchestration
- Kubernetes-ready architecture for future scaling

### Option 3: Complete Rewrite
- Microservices architecture with cloud-native patterns
- Replace Kailash SDK with cloud-native alternatives
- Maximum cloud optimization but high implementation risk

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Option 2: Hybrid Migration"**, because it provides the optimal balance of:
- **Risk mitigation**: Preserves proven Kailash SDK architecture
- **Cloud flexibility**: Linux containers deployable anywhere
- **Operational efficiency**: Docker-native monitoring and scaling
- **Future readiness**: Clear path to Kubernetes orchestration
- **Development velocity**: Maintains existing DataFlow and Nexus patterns

### Positive Consequences
- **Platform independence**: Deploy on any cloud provider or on-premises
- **Consistent environments**: Docker ensures dev/staging/prod parity
- **Operational automation**: Container orchestration handles scaling and health management
- **Security improvements**: Immutable container images with regular security updates
- **Cost optimization**: Efficient resource utilization and auto-scaling
- **Developer experience**: Simplified local development with docker-compose

### Negative Consequences
- **Migration complexity**: Requires careful orchestration of database and service migration
- **Learning curve**: Team needs Docker/Kubernetes expertise
- **Initial infrastructure investment**: Container registry, orchestration platform setup
- **Temporary operational overhead**: Running parallel environments during migration

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Lift-and-Shift Windows Containers
* Good, because minimal code changes required
* Good, because preserves exact current behavior
* Bad, because maintains Windows licensing costs
* Bad, because limits cloud provider options
* Bad, because doesn't improve operational efficiency

### Option 2: Hybrid Migration
* Good, because eliminates platform lock-in
* Good, because maintains proven SDK architecture
* Good, because enables modern DevOps practices
* Good, because provides clear scaling path
* Bad, because requires migration effort
* Bad, because needs new operational expertise

### Option 3: Complete Rewrite
* Good, because maximum cloud optimization
* Good, because modern microservices architecture
* Bad, because high implementation risk
* Bad, because loses proven business logic
* Bad, because extended development timeline

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. **Container Image Creation**
   - Linux-based Python runtime with Kailash SDK
   - Multi-stage builds for production optimization
   - Security scanning integration

2. **Service Containerization**
   - Nexus platform containerization
   - DataFlow models with PostgreSQL connectivity
   - MCP server containerization

3. **Local Development Environment**
   - Docker Compose for local development
   - Volume mounts for hot-reload development
   - Environment variable management

### Phase 2: Production Environment (Week 3-4)
1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Terraform for cloud resource provisioning
   - Docker Compose production configurations
   - Network security groups and policies

2. **Data Migration Strategy**
   - PostgreSQL container with data persistence
   - Migration scripts for schema and data transfer
   - Rollback procedures for failure scenarios

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Centralized logging with ELK stack

### Phase 3: Migration Execution (Week 5-6)
1. **Parallel Environment Setup**
   - Production Docker environment alongside Windows
   - Database replication for data synchronization
   - Load balancer configuration for traffic switching

2. **Gradual Traffic Migration**
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Canary releases for risk mitigation
   - Real-time monitoring and rollback triggers

3. **Windows Environment Decommission**
   - Verified service migration completion
   - Data integrity validation
   - Infrastructure cleanup

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Database Migration**
   - Risk: Data loss or corruption during migration
   - Mitigation: Full backup, replication, validation scripts

2. **Service Discovery**
   - Risk: Service connectivity issues between containers
   - Mitigation: Health checks, service mesh consideration

3. **Performance Regression**
   - Risk: Container overhead affecting response times
   - Mitigation: Load testing, performance benchmarking

### Rollback Procedures
- Automated traffic switching back to Windows environment
- Database point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Infrastructure tear-down scripts for rapid recovery

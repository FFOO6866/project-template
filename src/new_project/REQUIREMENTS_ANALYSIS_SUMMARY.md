# Requirements Analysis Summary
## Critical Infrastructure Recovery Plan - DATA-001

**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Status:** ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE  
**Priority:** 🚨 ULTRA-CRITICAL  
**Implementation Ready:** YES

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The requirements analysis for DATA-001: UNSPSC/ETIM Integration critical infrastructure collapse is complete. The root cause has been confirmed as **Kailash SDK importing Unix-only `resource` module**, making all development and testing impossible on Windows.

### Key Findings Confirmed
- **ZERO EXECUTABLE TESTS**: ModuleNotFoundError prevents any SDK imports
- **FALSE PROGRESS REPORTING**: TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT claims "COMPLETED" when no tests can run
- **21-Day Recovery Required**: Comprehensive infrastructure and compliance remediation needed

### Solution Strategy
**WSL2 + Docker Hybrid Development Environment** with systematic SDK compliance fixes and real infrastructure testing implementation.
